# Flynn is Unmaintained

Flynn is no longer being developed. _(Wondering what Flynn is? [Take a look at our older README](https://github.com/flynn/flynn/blob/2c20757de8b32a40ba06f7e5b363b2d4dd6b332e/README.md))_

All public Flynn-related infrastructure including binary release hosting and cluster discovery has been shut down.

Flynn no longer receives security updates, we strongly recommend transitioning to another system as soon as possible.

We thank everyone for their support and engagement over the years, and we're sorry that we won't be able to continue developing the platform.
